    "Tokenizers are one of the most important tools in nlp, which break down text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, characters or subwords, making complex sentence understandable to computers. Mainly tokenizers bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding."

    "* [`nltk`](https://www.nltk.org/) or natural language toolkit, will be employed for `data management` tasks. It offers comprehensive tools and resources for processing natural language task, making it a valuable choice for tasks such as text preprocessing, and analysis\n",
    "\n",

    "* [`XLNetTokenizer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer#xlnettokenizer) is another component of the Hugging Face Transformers library. It is tailored for tokenizing text in alignment with the XLNet model's requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`torchtext`](https://pytorch.org/text/stable/index.html) It is part of the PyTorch ecosystem, to handle various natural language processing tasks. It  simplifies the process of working with text data and provides functionalities for data preprocessing, tokenization, vocabulary management, and batching.\n"
