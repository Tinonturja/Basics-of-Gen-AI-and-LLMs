    "## **Data set**\n",
    "\n",
    "A data set in **PyTorch** is an object that represents a collection of data samples. Each data sample typically consists of one or more input features and their corresponding target labels. You can also use your data set to transform your data as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data loader**\n",
    "\n",
    "A data loader in **PyTorch** is responsible for efficiently loading and batching data from a data set. It abstracts away the process of iterating over a data set, shuffling, and dividing it into batches for training. In NLP applications, the data loader is used to process and transform your text data, rather than just the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data loaders have several key parameters, including the data set to load from, batch size (determining how many samples per batch), shuffle (whether to shuffle the data for each epoch), and more. Data loaders also provide an iterator interface, making it easy to iterate over batches of data during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you may ask, '**What is an iterator?**'\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator is an object that can be looped over. It contains elements that can be iterated through and typically includes two methods, `__iter__()` and `__next__()`. When there are no more elements to iterate over, it raises a **`StopIteration`** exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators are commonly used to traverse large data sets without loading all elements into memory simultaneously, making the process more memory-efficient. In PyTorch, not all data sets are iterators, but all data loaders are.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, the data loader processes data in batches, loading and processing one batch at a time into memory efficiently. The batch size, which you specify when creating the data loader, determines how many samples are processed together in each batch. The data loader's purpose is to convert input data and labels into batches of tensors with the same shape for deep learning models to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a data loader can be used for tasks such as tokenizing, sequencing, converting your samples to the same size, and transforming your data into tensors that your model can understand.\n",
